Hi! I'm Quan, a 5th-year Ph.D. student in Operations Management at Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, under the supervision of [Prof. Mehmet Gumus](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/mehmet-gumus){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Sentao Miao](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/sentaomiao/home){:target="_blank"}. I received my M.Eng from Memorial University of Newfoundland and my B.S. in Ocean Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before joining the Ph.D. program at McGill, I worked as an engineer and programmer for Memorial University and a startup for six years.

I am passionate about addressing business operational challenges through optimization, algorithm design, and other operations research tools. My current research focuses on revenue management and supply chain management, driven by real-world problems in e-commerce and platform services.
