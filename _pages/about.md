Hi there! I'm Quan, a Ph.D. student in Operations Management at [Desautels Faculty of Management](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/quan-zhou), McGill University. 

I received my M.Eng from Memorial University of Newfoundland, 
my B.S. in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before joining the Ph.D. program at McGill, I worked
as an engineer and programmer for Memorial University as well as a startup
for six years.
